# Very simple site wide password protection for Laravel5

This will add a simple password form in front of your application to protected it
from any access. The password is specified using the `.env` file to protect DEV
or STAGE sites only.

You can use multiple passwords for different user groups. Once the password is
removed, the access is revoked.

This does not protect any assets files like css or images.

## Installation

```
composer require elic-dev/laravel-site-protection
```

## Laravel 5

### Setup

Add ServiceProvider to the providers array in `app/config/app.php`.

```
ElicDev\SiteProtection\SiteProtectionServiceProvider::class,
```

Add Middleware to `app/Http/Kernel.php`.

```
protected $middlewareGroups = [
    'web' => [
        ...
        \ElicDev\SiteProtection\Http\Middleware\SiteProtection::class,
    ],
    ...
];
```

Add your password to `.env`. You can use multiple passwords separated by comma.

```
SITE_PROTECTION_PASSWORDS=password1,password2
```

To revoke access to your site simply change the password. This requires every
user using the old password to re-enter a password.

### Customization

To modify the view that handles password entry You need to first publish the view using this command:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="ElicDev\SiteProtection\SiteProtectionServiceProvider" --tag=views
```

You can make the changes in `resources/vendor/views/site-protection/site-protection-form.blade.php`.
